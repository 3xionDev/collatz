    <h1>Collatz Sequence Generator</h1>
    <h4>This is a tool that generates a Collatz sequence list from a given number using the Collatz Conjecture, commonly known as the 3x+1 problem. The conjecture proposes a simple set of rules that are repeatedly applied to a number: if the number is even, divide it by two. If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. These rules are applied repeately to the number until the sequence converges to 1. The Collatz Conjecture asserts that any positive integer that this sequence is applied to will eventually converge to 1.</h4>
